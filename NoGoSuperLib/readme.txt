Hello!

Thanks for the interest in this library. 

== What is SuperLib? ==
SuperLib is a library that consists of many sub libraries with
code mainly from CluelessPlus and PAXLink.

A general help and FAQ section exists in the main.nut.
You may also see the TT-forums thread about this library at:
  http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=47525 

Open each sub-library file to find the interface documentation.

== Background ==
As you might know CluelessPlus, PAXLink, TownCars and TutorialAI 
are all created by the same author. To reduce code duplication 
among these AIs, this library has been created. As a bonus, other 
AI authors can also use the library.

With the arrival of Game Scripts, a Game Script port of the library
has been started. It is basically just a rename of the API calls so
that it works for Game Scripts. Thus some parts might not work
correctly for Game Scripts. In that case it is valuable that people
report back this so that the functions can be fixed or removed from
the Game Script port of SuperLib.
