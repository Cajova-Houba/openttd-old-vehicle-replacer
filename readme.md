# Description

This script periodically scans vehicles and if old vehicle is found, it is sent to depo. Once the vehicle is in depo, script will clone it, start the new one and sell the old one. 

It is based on the [Minimal GS](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=62163).

# Installation
